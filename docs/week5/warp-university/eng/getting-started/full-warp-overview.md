# A Full Warp Overview

## 전체 자막

Hi, I'm Zach, Warp's founder and CEO.

Excited to show you Warp today. So, when you open Warp, what you're going to see is a command line interface. It is a aentic development environment, which means it's a place where the primary way of interacting with it is prompting an agent to do something. But in Warp, you can also just run terminal commands and use it like a regular command line. If I go ahead in here and run ls or pwd, you see that we run terminal commands. If I type in English in warp, it will interpret it as uh launching an agent and the agent will do something for you.

So for instance, I could be like describe my open git changes and this will kick off an agent flow where the agent will um basically run any commands or do any context gathering it needs in order to answer the query or do the thing that you asked it to do. So this was really simple. It's just telling me about my current git branch.
