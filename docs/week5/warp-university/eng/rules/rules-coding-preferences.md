# Set Coding Preferences with Rules

[영상 바로가기](https://youtu.be/zWvRB2zWr-4)

## 전체 자막

Add a rule with your environment preferences. For example, when I'm using an agent like Claude, it tends to use npm by default, but I prefer to use PNPM for managing larger web projects with workspaces. So, I set up a rule and described my preference to use PNPM or default to whatever is currently in the project. That way, it knows to use pmpp first when it's updating dependencies.

And you can also update your Python environment, for example, to always use Minionda. Or if you're building desktop apps with the Tori CLI, you can default to that manager instead.
