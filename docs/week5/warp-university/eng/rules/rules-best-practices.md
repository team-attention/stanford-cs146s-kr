# Set Coding Best Practices with Rules

[영상 바로가기](https://youtu.be/AuM2OIvXlnY)

## 전체 자막

You'll want rules to author your code.

This can get pretty detailed and personal, but it's best to start by just telling the agent to format and check its work and also describe your preferences, like using types over interfaces in Typescript. This helps an agent write code correctly the first time and catch errors before returning with the solution. I also like to improve code comment quality by using the Hemingway test, which is inspired by Ernest Hemingway, who had a way with keeping things simple. This keeps your JS docs nice and readable.
