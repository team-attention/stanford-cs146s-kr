# Using Context7 MCP Server

[영상 바로가기](https://youtu.be/ssYE25sP7pc)

## 전체 자막

The context 7 MCP server gives warp agents realtime access to documentation from across the web. Here I'm using it to update my share brew files project which is an older Astro site I built a couple of years ago. The prompt is pretty simple which is just to update the Astro project to follow the latest best practices. The MCP server calls get library docs to pull the latest Astro 5 docs. Warp then applies updates across the project like updating my Tailwind import syntax, improving my TypeScript configuration, optimizing my build settings, and adding better accessibility rules. You'll see it pulling in the Astrodocs and making the code changes across multiple files. This saves me hours of reading change logs and blog posts just to find out what has changed in the last couple of years. I find this especially useful when reviving old projects or migrating to a new framework version and wanting to make sure I'm still following the latest standards.
