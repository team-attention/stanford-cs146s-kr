## 전체 자막

Building REST APIs for your projects come with a lot of overhead. Test suites are great for alleviating these pains, but by doing this, you'll just get subpar results. So, here's a better prompt that you can use that will make developing your app much faster by yourself and with the AI. In this prompt, we get specific what we are looking for. Unit test and security tests. This will generate tests that you can run with a simple command after you're ready to commit changes or deploy. But more importantly, you can add this command to your rules file. So, Warp will use these tests as a source of truth to determine if the code written by it is worth implementing.
