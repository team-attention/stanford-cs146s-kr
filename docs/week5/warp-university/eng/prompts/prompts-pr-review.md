# Reviewing PRs Like A Senior Dev

[영상 바로가기](https://youtu.be/NVwqQyphlAw)

## 전체 자막

Reviewing large pull requests can sometimes be tricky. It's also dense with large walls of text. You could ask AI to summarize like this. Summarize this pull request, but the issue is that you're not getting the full picture and are relying on an AI to do the checking for you, which can be very risky. Here's a prompt to make reviewing pull requests much faster. This prompt will instead create an index and priority list, which will give you a route in order to effectively navigate the large pull request. It will also identify obvious red flags that we can rely on AI to catch. Now, if you're using a weaker model, you can take advantage of the structured output to guarantee the provided output. AI is a very handy tool, but always make sure you're checking the work going into your applications.
