# Create a Production Ready Docker Setup

## 전체 자막

We've all been there. You realize that this should have been in a Docker container from the start. So, you do create a Docker file. And although you save time writing this, now you have to waste time configuring it. But good news, here's a prompt that will immediately help. Since projects inside of Docker often include multiple needed items, Warp can analyze the entire project and build the Docker files with multi-stage configuration and small image size, a Docker ignore file to ignore large files, and a Docker compose file to orchestrate needed containers in a development environment as well as production. Your afternoon is saved.

Back to work.
