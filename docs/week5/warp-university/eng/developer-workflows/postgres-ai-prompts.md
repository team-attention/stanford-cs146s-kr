# Write Postgres Command with AI Prompts

## 전체 자막

Hey, so today I'm going to show you one of the cooler but more hidden features in Warp, which is that you can use Warp's AI functionality within um long running terminal apps in ripples to help you sort of figure out how to do any any kind of interactive work you might do in one of those tools. I'm going to show you this using uh the Postgres ripple, but this would work in Node, it would work in Python, it would work in GDB, it would work in my SQL. So feel free to play around with it. So I'm going to go into this ripple and let's say I don't know how to use Postgres, which honestly I don't really know how to use Postgres.

I'm going to hit command I and command I is going to bring up our generate input and in here you can type or speak English and your English will be translated into the language of whatever ripple you're in. So here I'm going to be like uh show me all tables and you'll see this translates to this TT command. I'm going to do show me our users table and our teams table. I'll have it do two things at once. And what's cool is as I'm doing this, it's learning the uh structure and it's learning whatever data is being printed out uh within this uh within the ripple.

and so that I can do something really cool. Show me all of the users who have joined Warp in the last 90 days from public email accounts like Gmail, Yahoo, Hotmail and are on teams of more than two people.

So I hit my voice hotkey here to speak to Warp. You'll see I could do that. I get a really cool somewhat complicated query that I can then run just one person meeting that that criteria. This is all fake data anyway, so I'm not too concerned about you all seeing it.

Anyhow, super cool feature. Have fun playing with it
