# How Warp Uses Warp to Build Warp

## The Coding Mandate

*Warp's coding mandate: start every coding task with Warp*

1. Every coding task should start with a prompt in Warp.
2. If the coding task succeeds, great! Share the success in #warped-it
3. If, after ten minutes, you feel like you are wasting time by prompting…
    1. Please share feedback with the relevant #feedback- channel on what failed
    2. Please also share your prompt, conversation id, and so on so we can learn where the issue was and possibly build an eval around it
    3. This is also a chance for folks to give each other tips on how best to use Warp to code
4. Next, you are encouraged to try another AI coding tool (e.g. Cursor, Claude) and see if you have more luck – if you do, please report what went well and what didn't.
5. Finally, just code by hand…we need to actually ship software and if that's still fastest, you should do it.

*Warp's coding mandate: the "why"*

1. Coding in Warp by prompt is actually faster for many tasks and should increase our overall engineering output.
    1. it saves you time from having to handwrite code
    2. it allows for multi-threaded development
    3. it's especially useful when working on areas of code you are less familiar with, which, as our codebase grows, is likely a lot – Warp can really help you learn these new parts of the codebase quickly
2. Dogfooding our product is the best way to improve it.
    1. A big part of the reasoning for the mandate is to use and give feedback on what we are building.
    2. We are asking our users to work this way and betting our business on it, so we had better believe enough in the workflow that we are willing to use it ourselves
3. Using competitor products builds our intuition on where our product might improve and what is possible.

## Guidelines for coding with Warp

### You are responsible for the code you submit for review

- You **must** understand all code that you submit for review at the same level as if you had written it by yourself
- Any code generated by agent mode **must** be at the same quality we expect for hand-written code…
    - It must be well-factored
    - It must be well-tested
    - It must follow our coding conventions wrt comments, apis, imports, test file location, etc
    - And so on…
- It is never an excuse for a bug or poor code quality to say "AI wrote this" – AI is a tool, not a responsible party on our software team
- All of the guidelines in our regular How We Code still apply when coding by prompt (small PRs, feature flags, and so on)

### Don't just tell the agent what outcome you want, tell the agent how to engineer the change

- In other words, if you just tell the agent "I want a feature that works like X" the agent is likely to produce code that isn't up to our standards.
- Instead, tell the agent *how* to build the feature
    - What should the data model look like
    - What is the api we want
    - Where should the code live
    - What tests should it write
- Just letting the agent goal seek based on the outcome will end up wasting a lot of time by producing code that may "work" but that isn't maintainable, testable, composable, etc

### Break down coding tasks into smaller components / do not one shot large changes

- You will find that coding with Warp is more effective if you ask the agent to make small, self-contained changes and commits and verify it is on the right track frequently
- An anti-pattern is trying to one-shot complex changes that require the agent to produce a lot of code. One-shotting is fine for simple changes, but not for more complex features.
- Having the agent frequently write tests as it goes is a good way of forcing it to work incrementally.
- Frequently look at the change that's in progress to make sure it's proceeding how it would if you were to write it by hand.
    1. For now, you can use the Github UI or another PR review tool
    2. Eventually Warp will support this review flow more natively
- Have Warp make commits for you with good messages as it goes so you can revert if you need to

### Make sure you comprehend / understand what Warp is doing

- It's good to ask for an explanation or plan before Warp starts making changes
- Iterate on the plan and ask for options and different approaches to the change. Make sure you get the big picture before it starts making diffs
- Conversely, you can have Warp do a big change end to end to see what's possible, but expect to have to go back and break that up into comprehensible pieces post-hoc to meet our quality bar.

### Invest time in learning to get the most out of Warp code

- You will build instincts around what context to include, what types of prompting works best, and so on as you use Warp more to code
- Please share this knowledge with our team – coding by prompt is a totally new discipline and we all have different instincts on how to do it well. We will learn faster together.
- Use the advanced features of Warp to improve your workflows…
    - Use rules, prompts, and WD objects as persistent context
    - Use "@" for tagging files
    - Attach images for UI changes and debugging
    - Experiment with different models
- Set up multiple copies of warp-internal and warp-server locally so you can effectively multi-thread

### Report issues

- I can't emphasize this enough – if something isn't working well, report it to the appropriate #feedback- channel
- That could mean
    - Server errors or client bugs
    - Agent going in circles, burning requests and wasting time
    - Agent forgetting context
    - Missing functionality that would help you achieve the task
    - High latency, AI acting dumb, mis-applied diffs, whatever…
- On the feedback handling side, our first instinct with these issues should be **make evals for them**

### Set up MCP servers for easily retrieving context

- Servers we should all have…
    - Sentry
    - Linear
    - Notion
    - Slack
    - <what else>
- You'll be surprised how capable agent mode is at fixing panics and getting up to speed from linear.

### Set up rules for repeated conventions

- Take the time to set up Warp Drive rules for things you find yourself repeatedly instructing the agent to do (e.g. what linters to run, what our code conventions are on unwrap / expect, imports, test location, etc)

### Set up prompts for repeated workflows

- If you find yourself repeating a task, it's worth setting up a Warp Drive prompt for it.
- For example, I use prompts for generating commits, opening and editing PR descriptions, resolving merge conflicts and more.
