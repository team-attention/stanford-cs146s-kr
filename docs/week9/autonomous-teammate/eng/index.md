# Resolve AI Product Deep Dive: Your New Autonomous Teammate

Engineers often find themselves bogged down with operational tasks like incident response, leaving little time for what they love most – coding and building new things. On-call duties are particularly draining, constantly interrupting workflows and adding stress to the day. That's why we're thrilled to introduce our first product, **AI Production Engineer** – a tireless, autonomous teammate designed to handle alerts, perform root cause analysis, resolve incidents, and make on-call stress-free.

Production incidents are high-stakes events. They can disrupt customer experiences, affect revenue, and even put your company's reputation at risk. The unpredictability of these issues, combined with limited visibility and the challenge of coordinating across teams, makes them exhausting to deal with – and often leads to burnout. But it doesn't have to be this way.

## Meet Your New On-Call Teammate

Resolve AI has built a foundational AI platform for production engineering that transforms incident investigation and resolution. This allows engineers to stay focused on what they do best – innovating and shaping the future. Resolve AI understands your production systems and tools, responds to alerts, collaborates with you, and saves you time by identifying what's wrong, how to fix it, and building an automated post-incident review.

## Understands Your Systems and Tools at Light-speed

Getting started with Resolve AI is quick. It seamlessly connects with all your infrastructure – right down to individual pods, and to your tools from observability platforms like Grafana and Datadog, to CI/CD pipelines like Jenkins and codebase in GitHub.

From the moment you integrate Resolve AI, it begins comprehensively mapping your environment and constructs a dynamic knowledge graph of your entire system and tools, continuously updating it in real-time as new deployments, system events, configuration changes, or code changes occur. This deep, up-to-the-minute understanding empowers Resolve AI to traverse all dependencies, pods, and deployments swiftly, and it responds accurately whenever you need it most.

## Responds to Alerts Before You Log In

When an alert is triggered, Resolve AI springs into action. Like an on-call engineer, it immediately begins investigating by examining all the relevant data. It autonomously creates and executes a set of just-in-time runbooks, reviewing metrics, dashboards, code changes, deployments, and logs.

In less than a minute, Resolve AI has already pinpointed a root cause theory and suggested steps to fix it. You get a clear head start, without the usual chaos.

> "Resolve AI is my go-to for investigating production issues. It analyzes everything upfront, so I can start solving the problem right away without digging through logs or dashboards across many tools."

## Tells You What's Wrong and How to Fix It

Resolve AI conducts a comprehensive analysis of the entire event, tracking every change and system behavior to pinpoint the root cause. It can intelligently interpret dashboards, review logs, and detect anomalies. Whether it's a configuration error, code change, downstream service issue, or deployment problem, Resolve AI identifies it all with precision.

It develops a theory, explains how it arrived there, and provides actionable steps to resolve it. It applies complex human-like logic, judgment and reasoning at every step of the way. No more guessing games or digging through tools for hours.

## Collaborate, Guide, or Let Resolve AI Take the Wheel

You can work with Resolve AI as if it were a teammate. Ask it questions, explore other theories, or even tell it to take action, like rolling back to the last deployment or restarting a pod. You can even loop it into your conversations with @mentions in Slack or through the Resolve AI UI.

## Saves You Time on Incident Reviews

Once the incident is resolved, Resolve AI puts together a detailed post-incident review, summarizing everything from the initial alert to the root cause and the steps taken to resolve it. This saves you hours of operational time and gives you a clear, concise record to learn from and improve for next time.
